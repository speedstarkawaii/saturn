roblox exploit by editing script open source comes with a bad ui

**pleaase** do not skid off this this is only learning base i did while i was learn external how it works yk blah blah

# how it works ‚ùî

create a handle of roblox

you can now write/read do as you wish with the memory

# a few things ‚úè

1: for **starters** this is a base; meaning you learn from it, you add on from it. you shouldnt be using or relying on this forever. i only made this to give people an idea how roblox exploits nowadays work.

2: there isnt much "UNC" on this you can just add it on yourself

3: THIS WILL NOT GET NEW UPDATES as its a base and only to teach people


# usage ‚úÖ

first proper credits to github for main source and whereu got ti from

always release x64 (may need to change build path its in project properties outout directory just put that to yours

# WARNING ‚ö†

**DETECTED** use at own risk it will ban you as it does edit the bytecode of script ‚ö†
